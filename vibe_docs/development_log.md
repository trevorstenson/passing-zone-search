### 2025-01-27 - NiceGUI-Style Enhancement
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT  
**Changed**: Completely redesigned search interface to match NiceGUI responsive search style

- Keyboard navigation (‚Üë‚Üì arrows, Enter to open) for power users
- Smooth hover effects and visual feedback
- Better space efficiency matching NiceGUI's clean aesthetic
**Next**: Continue with planned deployment preparation
