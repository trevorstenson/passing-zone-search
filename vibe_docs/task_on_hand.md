# üéØ Current Task: Fuzzy Search Web App for Passing.Zone Patterns

_Started: 2025-01-27_
_Status: ‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT PHASE - UI Upgrade with shadcn/ui Complete_

## üìã PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### Project Name

Passing Zone Fuzzy Search Web App

### Project Description

Build a simple web app that provides very good fuzzy search for the juggling patterns hosted on passing.zone/category/patterns/. The current search functionality on passing.zone is inadequate, and users need a better way to find juggling patterns using fuzzy matching for typos and partial searches.

### Target Users

Primarily jugglers who need to search for specific juggling patterns. Users should be able to search with incomplete or misspelled input and get relevant results.

### Success Criteria

- Intuitive fuzzy search functionality that handles typos and partial matches
- Clean, responsive interface showing pattern details
- Fast search results that update as user types
- Links to original pattern pages on passing.zone
- Pattern categorization and tagging visible in results
