## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

### Project Name

Passing Zone Fuzzy Search

### Problem Statement

The search fucntionality on https://passing.zone/category/patterns/ is abysmal. I want to implement a small web app for proper fuzzy search of all patterns living on passing.zone.

### Vision

What I describe above.

## ðŸ‘¥ Users & Stakeholders

### Primary Users

Primaryily jugglers will be using this web-app to search for patterns on passing.zone.

### User Needs

Users need the ability to search for juggling patterns based on incomplete or fuzzy input, and click through to open the real passing.zone page for the pattern.

### Stakeholders

Jugglers.

## ðŸ“Š Business Requirements

### Core Features

Proper/good fuzzy search functionality for juggling patterns on passing.zone.

### Success Metrics

If search is intuitive.

### Constraints

[Business constraints, timeline, budget]

## ðŸŽ¨ Product Requirements

### User Experience Goals

Should be a sleek UI that is easy to use.

### Brand/Design Guidelines

None right now.

### Accessibility Requirements

[Accessibility standards to meet]

## ðŸ”— External Dependencies

### Integrations

[External systems to integrate with]

### Data Sources

There aren't that many patterns on passing.zone, so I can probably host the titles/links in-memory. We just need a way to scrape this and update it semi-regularly.

### Compliance Requirements

[Legal, regulatory, security requirements]
